# Mother Night

## Witches of [[Mother Night]] 

While the good-hearted worshippers of Barovia keep the faith of the [[Morninglord]] alive, other, darker individuals seek the power and favor of [[Mother Night]] instead. Chief among them is Baba Lysaga, the Witch of Berez, who has fostered a coven of fellow devotees by recruiting outcasts and exiles from the settlements of Barovia. The maddened Lysaga views these practitioners as her children, and teaches them to secretly consider themselves the younger siblings of Strahd—sworn to protect and obey him for eternity. 

These witches are largely as described in Barovian Witch (p. 229), though their pacts are forged with [[Mother Night]] instead of Strahd and the Dark Powers. Those sent to Ravenloft serve at the pleasure of Ludmilla Vilisevic, Strahd’s magic-minded consort, though none forget that their true loyalty is owed to [[Baba Lysaga]] of the swamp—and, above her, to Strahd himself.
